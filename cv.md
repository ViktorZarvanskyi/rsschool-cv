### About me
I am an senior engineer technologist at SEBN-UA. I have been working at the plant for 10 years. To work, you always need to learn something new. The last of my great training is “REFA-INTERNATIONAL”. Six months ago I tried to write code and I liked it. I really want to master the new profession of Front-end developer. And in this my desire to constantly learn something new will help me.
